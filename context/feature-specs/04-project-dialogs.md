Goal
Build the /editor home screen and add project dialogs/sidebar actions. No API calls or persistence yet.

Editor Home
Reuse the existing editor layout. Do not modify the navbar or sidebar behavior.

In the center of the page, add:

heading: Create a project or open an existing one

description: Start a new architecture workspace, or choose a project from the sidebar.

New Project button with a Plus icon

Keep the layout minimal. Do not wrap this content in cards.

Clicking New Project should open the Create Project dialog.

Dialogs
Create Project
project name input

live slug preview based on the name

preview updates as the user types

Rename Project
prefilled project name input

current project name shown in the description

input auto-focuses

Enter submits

Delete Project
destructive confirmation only

no input

confirm button uses destructive styling.

On mobile:

tapping outside the sidebar closes it

add a backdrop scrim

Implementation
Create a dedicated hook to manage:

dialog state

form state

loading state

Wire:editor home New Project Create dialog 
sidebar create Create dialog 
sidebar rename Rename dialog 
sidebar delete Delete dialogUse
mock project data for now. Do not add API calls or persistence.
